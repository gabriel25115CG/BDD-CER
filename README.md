The Renewable Energy Community Management System (RECMS) project aims to establish a robust and comprehensive platform for the efficient management of a community focused on renewable energy. This innovative initiative aligns with the transition towards a sustainable energy future, emphasizing collaboration and intelligent resource management.

Member Management: The RECMS will enable the registration and management of community members, providing personalized profiles and integrated communication tools. This feature facilitates transparency and collaboration within the community.

Production Site Monitoring: A real-time monitoring interface for renewable energy production sites will be implemented. Members can access detailed data on production, consumption, and performance of the installations.

Resource Sharing: RECMS will facilitate resource sharing among community members, promoting more efficient use of renewable energy production capacities. This may include mechanisms for energy exchange, shared storage, and other collaborative initiatives.

Project Management: Members will have the opportunity to propose and participate in projects related to renewable energy. The system will track and manage the progress of these projects, fostering innovation within the community.

Data Analysis: Advanced analysis tools will be integrated to allow members to interpret production and consumption data. These analyses will support informed decision-making to optimize resource utilization.

Advantages of RECMS:

Community Sustainability: Promotes the development of self-sufficient and resilient communities, reducing dependence on conventional energy sources.

Transparency and Engagement: Encourages transparency within the community by providing real-time information on energy production and fostering active member engagement.

Cost Reduction: Optimizes resource utilization by facilitating the sharing and exchange of energy, contributing to cost reduction for community members.

Collaborative Innovation: Stimulates innovation by empowering members to propose, develop, and implement renewable energy-related projects collaboratively.

La base se trouve dans le dossier SCRIPT / SQL  PROJETBDD.sql
ATTENTION : La base de données est hébergée sur un serveur différent que le serveur web. Dans les requêtes SQL la cible pour se connecter n’est pas localhost mais 10.20.20.40 (Dans les script PHP du site) il peut être nécessaire de remplacer ces conditions pour une complète utilisation.


In conclusion, RECMS represents a significant step towards intelligent community management of renewable energy, fostering sustainability, collaboration, and innovation within the community.
